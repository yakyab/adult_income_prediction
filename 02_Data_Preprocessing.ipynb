In this step, we will use Scikit-Learn's StandardScaler to scale the numerical features."

By dealing with missing values, we ensure that our machine learning models will be trained on a complete dataset, leading to more reliable predictions. By transforming categorical variables into a numerical format and scaling numerical variables, we allow a wider range of machine learning algorithms to be applied to our dataset. This increases the chances of finding a high-performing model that can provide valuable insights for decision-making."

    "In this notebook, we carried out several preprocessing steps on the \"Adult\" dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We began by loading the data from a URL and displaying the first few rows to understand its structure.\n",
    "2. Next, we handled missing values. The dataset used the \"?\" character to denote missing values. We replaced these with NaNs and then filled them using the most frequent value in each column.\n",
    "3. We then converted categorical variables into numeric format using one-hot encoding. This step is essential as many machine learning algorithms can only handle numeric input.\n",
    "4. After that, we scaled the numerical variables using StandardScaler. This step is important because many machine learning algorithms perform better when the input variables are on the same scale.\n",
    "5. Finally, we saved the preprocessed data to a CSV file, so we can easily load it in the subsequent notebooks for further analysis, visualization, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebooks, we will be able to focus on exploring the relationships between different variables in the data, visualizing these relationships, and eventually training machine learning models. All these steps will bring us closer to our business goal of predicting whether a person earns over 50k a year, which could help in making informed decisions in a variety of contexts, such as targeted advertising, policy planning, or resource allocation."
