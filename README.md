# Adult Income Prediction
The project is aimed at predicting whether an individual's income exceeds 50k USD annually based on various socio-economic characteristics.

## Business Problem
Predicting individuals' incomes can have significant implications for many different sectors. For instance, banks could utilize this information for loan decisions, insurance companies could use it for risk assessments, and governments could use it for tax income estimation.

## Project Structure
The project consists of five Jupyter notebooks:

1. "01_Data_Exploration.ipynb": Exploration and understanding of the data structure.
2. "02_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb": Data preprocessing, including data cleaning and encoding of categorical variables.
3. "03_Data_Visualization.ipynb": Data visualization to understand the distribution of data and relationships among different features.
4. "04_Statistical_Analysis.ipynb": Conducting statistical analysis to understand which features have the greatest impact on income.
5. "05_Machine_Learning.ipynb": Machine learning, including training and testing various models, as well as model optimization.
