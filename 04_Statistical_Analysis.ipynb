    "The effect size (Cohen's d) is a measure of the magnitude of the difference between two groups. Here, we use it to quantify the difference in means of our numerical variables between the two income groups. Generally, an absolute value of d=0.2 is considered a 'small' effect size, 0.5 represents a 'medium' effect size, and 0.8 a 'large' effect size. The results show that all the numerical variables have a small to medium effect size, implying there is a small to medium difference in means between the two income groups for these variables.\n",

    "## General Summary\n",
    "In this notebook, we conducted a thorough statistical analysis of the variables in our dataset to understand which ones significantly influence income. We started with hypothesis testing for numerical variables using t-tests, then proceeded to hypothesis testing for categorical variables using chi-square tests. We also explored the correlation between numerical variables using Spearman correlation analysis. Subsequently, we ran a logistic regression analysis to evaluate the impact of different variables on the target variable. Our results provide valuable insights into the structure of the dataset and the relationships between different variables. The findings from this notebook will be instrumental in the upcoming feature selection and model building stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Summary\n",
    "Our statistical analysis confirmed several intuitive assumptions about factors influencing income. The level of education, age, and hours per week worked significantly affect a person's income. This information will help us create a more accurate prediction model in the next stages. Additionally, it gives us a better understanding of the demographic and socioeconomic factors that impact income, which could be crucial for decision-makers."
